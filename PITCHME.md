### <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Background</span>
* Strong influence of parents on the religious orientations and behaviors of their children (Myers 1996; Sherkat 1998; Smith 2009).
<br>
<br>
 - <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Social learning</span>: children observe and reproduce parents' behavior (Bandura 1977)
 - <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Family solidarity</span>: affection and social bonds (Bengtson 2002)

<span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">What if parents do not share the same religion?</span>

* Interreligious parents in US are more likely to produce less religious children (Hoge 1978; Nelsen 1990; Petts & Knoester 2007).

* <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Research Question:</span> How does the religiosity of respondents with interreligious parents differ from respondents with same-faith parents?
  - Cross-nationally?

### <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Data</span>

* 2008 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) Religion III Module
  - _N_ = 59,986 from 35 countries
  - 18 years old and older
  - Sampling: SRS or Multi-stage stratified
  - Multi-mode: face-to-face, mailed, and telephone
  <br>
  <br>
* Final Analysis Sample:  _n_ = 32,313

### <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Dependent Variable</span>
* _Standardized Respondent Religiosity Scale_
  - self-rated: 7-pt index (extremely, very, somewhat)
  - belief: 6-pt index (Don't believe to No doubts)
  - prayer: 11-pt index (Never" to >1/day)
  - attendance: 9-pt index (Never to >1/week)
  <br>
  <br>
$\mu = 0$  
$\sigma = 1$  
range = (-1.9, 1.8)

  - High-High, High-Low, High-Never, Low-Low, Low-Never, Never-Never

### <right><span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Analytic Strategy</span></right>
* Multi-level Regression Analysis: Fixed Effects
  - Level 1: Country (_n_ = 35)
  - Level 2: Individual Respondents (_n_ = 32,313)
<br>
<br>
* Adjusts for unobserved country-level confounders that may affect both parental and respondent religiosity
* Focal IV is an individual-level (Level 2) variable
