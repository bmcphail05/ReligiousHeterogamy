### <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Background</span>
* Strong influence of parents on the religious orientations and behaviors of their children (Myers 1996; Sherkat 1998; Smith 2009).
<br>
<br>
 - <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Social learning</span>: children observe and reproduce parents' behavior (Bandura 1977)
 - <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Family solidarity</span>: affection and social bonds (Bengtson 2002)

<span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">What if parents do not share the same religion?</span>

* Interreligious parents in US are more likely to produce less religious children (Hoge 1978; Nelsen 1990; Petts & Knoester 2007).

* <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Research Question:</span> How does the religiosity of respondents with interreligious parents differ from respondents with same-faith parents?
  - Cross-nationally?

---
### <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Data</span>

* 2008 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) Religion III Module
  - _N_ = 59,986 from 35 countries
  - 18 years old and older
  - Sampling: SRS or Multi-stage stratified
  - Multi-mode: face-to-face, mailed, and telephone
  <br>
  <br>
* Final Analysis Sample:  _n_ = 32,313
---
### <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Dependent Variable</span>
* _Standardized Respondent Religiosity Scale_
  - self-rated: 7-pt index (extremely, very, somewhat)
  - belief: 6-pt index (Don't believe to No doubts)
  - prayer: 11-pt index (Never" to >1/day)
  - attendance: 9-pt index (Never to >1/week)

---
### <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Focal Independent Variables</span>
* _Combinations of Parents' Religious ID_
  - Same-Faith (81%), Mixed-Faith (5%), Faith-None (7%), & No Faith (7%)
* _Combinations of Parent's Religious Attendance_  
  - High-High, High-Low, High-Never, Low-Low, Low-Never, Never-Never
<br>
<br>
<span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold; test-align:left">Control Variables</span>: _Age, Education, Self-placement, Female, Married, Children, Urban, Income_

---
### <right><span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Analytic Strategy</span></right>
* Multi-level Regression Analysis: Fixed Effects
  - Level 1: Country (_n_ = 35)
  - Level 2: Individual Respondents (_n_ = 32,313)
<br>
<br>
* Adjusts for unobserved country-level confounders that may affect both parental and respondent religiosity
* Focal IV is an individual-level (Level 2) variable

---
### <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Discussion</span>
* Interreligious parents are less effective than parents who share the same religious affiliation in transmitting religion to the next generation, but this difference can largely be attributed to lower levels of religious attendance rather than having a different religious affiliation.
