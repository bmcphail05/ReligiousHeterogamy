### <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Background</span>
* Strong influence of parents on the religious orientations and behaviors of their children (Myers 1996; Sherkat 1998; Smith 2009).
<br>
<br>
 - <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Social learning</span>: children observe and reproduce parents' behavior (Bandura 1977)
 - <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Family solidarity</span>: affection and social bonds (Bengtson 2002)

### <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Religious Heterogamy</span>

<span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">How does the religiosity of respondents with mixed-faith parents differ from respondents with same-faith parents?</span>

* Research in US: mixed-faith parents = less religious children (Hoge 1978; Nelsen 1990; Petts & Knoester 2007)

* Cross-nationally?

  - 18 years old and older
  - Sampling: SRS or Multi-stage stratified
  - Multi-mode: face-to-face, mailed, and telephone

* _Standardized Religiosity Scale_
  - self-id: 7-pt index (extremely, very, somewhat)
  - belief: 6-pt index (Don't believe to No doubts)
  - prayer: 11-pt index (Never" to >1/day)
  - attendance: 9-pt index (Never to >1/week)

* Multi-level Regression Analysis: Fixed Effects
  - Level 1: Country
  - Level 2: Individual Respondents
<br>
<br>
* Adjusts for unobserved country-level confounders that may affect both parental and respondent religiosity
* Focal IV is an individual-level (Level 2) variable

### <span style="color:#e49436; font-weight:bold">Discussion</span>
This research project draws attention to the under-recognized impact of religious heterogamy on both religious inheritance as well as the future of religion in China. Scholars have argued that transitions in a society's religious landscape are the result of generational changes in religious affiliation, belief, and practice [@chaves1989; @sherkat2001; @crockett2006; @voas2016; @chaves2017]. These changes in religiosity across generations are directly associated with differential fertility rates of religious groups [@roof1987; @mosher1992; @hout2001; @voas2003; @pewresearchcenter2015] and the efficacy of religious socialization.
